SaltyBot shall connect twitch.tv/saltyteemo and bet on teams.

## Improvements / TODO

- Automatic Fetch of Balance when starting

- OAUTH and Nick being passed as params or in file

- log output revamp

- increasing accuracy

## SpicyBot Evolution

We need to create better log messages, to create a Data Set we can subsequentially analyse. E.g. looking at the gross win by odds distribution. With this data we can then create SpicyBot, hopefully with a bitter gross win than SaltyBot.
